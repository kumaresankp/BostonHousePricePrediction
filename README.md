# Boston House Price Prediction
This project focuses on predicting house prices in the Boston area using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the prices of houses based on various features.

# Dataset
The project uses the well-known Boston Housing dataset, which is available in the scikit-learn library. The dataset contains 506 samples with 13 features, including factors like crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, and pupil-teacher ratio by town.
